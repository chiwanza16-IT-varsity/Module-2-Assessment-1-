            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            <p>Gemsbok, also known as oryx, are majestic antelopes belonging to the genus Oryx within the family Bovidae. Two species are commonly recognized, the Southern gemsbok (Oryx gazella) and the East African gemsbok (Oryx beisa), though some taxonomic debates persist. Gemsbok are native to arid regions of Southern Africa and East Africa, including countries like Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.</p>
           <p>Gemsbok possess several distinctive features that aid in their survival in harsh desert environments. They have long, straight horns that extend backward from the head, which they use for defense against predators and for establishing dominance within their herds. Their coats are a striking blend of white and grayish-brown, providing effective camouflage in the sandy landscapes they inhabit. Additionally, gemsbok have adapted to conserve water efficiently, enabling them to survive for extended periods without drinking.</p>
           <p>These antelopes are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of desert vegetation including grasses, leaves, and succulents. They are well adapted to the arid habitats they inhabit, often congregating around waterholes or seasonal rivers where they can quench their thirst and find food. Gemsbok are highly social animals, forming herds of up to 30 individuals, although larger aggregations may occur during migrations or in areas with abundant resources.</p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>You will find the gemsbok in the arid section of the zoo, located adjacent to the reptile house.</p>
