            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
            <p>Gorillas are fascinating primates, belonging to the genus Gorilla within the family Hominidae. They are the largest living primates and share a close evolutionary relationship with humans. Gorillas are native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa, inhabiting countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda.</p>
            <p>One of the most distinctive features of gorillas is their robust build and muscular physique. They have broad chests and shoulders, which are indicative of their immense strength. Gorillas have large heads with pronounced brow ridges and a sagittal crest, a bony ridge on top of the skull that provides attachment points for their powerful jaw muscles. Additionally, male gorillas develop silver or gray hair on their backs as they mature, earning them the nickname "silverbacks."</p>
            <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, with their diet consisting mainly of fruits, leaves, stems, and shoots. They are known to forage on the forest floor and in the trees, utilizing their dexterous hands and opposable thumbs to manipulate food items. Gorillas live in cohesive social groups known as troops, led by a dominant silverback male. Troops typically consist of several adult females, their offspring, and subordinate males.</p>
            <p>Gorillas are highly intelligent and exhibit complex social behaviors. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions, allowing them to maintain group cohesion and resolve conflicts. Despite their formidable appearance, gorillas are generally peaceful animals, preferring to avoid confrontations with other animals, including humans.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You will find the gorillas in the Primate House, located in the heart of the zoo's conservation area.</p>
