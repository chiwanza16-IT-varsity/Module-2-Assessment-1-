            <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are beloved creatures native to the mountainous bamboo forests of central China. They are members of the bear family Ursidae and are characterized by their distinctive black-and-white fur coats. Pandas are celebrated worldwide for their cute and cuddly appearance, as well as their gentle demeanor.</p>
            <p>One of the most iconic features of pandas is their diet, which consists almost entirely of bamboo. They are highly specialized herbivores, with digestive systems adapted to process tough bamboo leaves and stems. Pandas have a pseudo-thumb, an extension of the wrist bone, which helps them grip and manipulate bamboo shoots with remarkable dexterity.</p>
            <p>Pandas are solitary animals, except during the breeding season and when caring for their young. They have a primarily sedentary lifestyle, spending much of their time foraging for bamboo and resting. Despite their large size, pandas are skilled climbers and may ascend trees to feed on higher branches or to escape from predators.</p>
            <p>Conservation efforts are underway to protect pandas and their habitats, as they face numerous threats including habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Giant panda reserves and breeding centers have been established in China to help safeguard these iconic animals and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe pandas in the Panda Pavilion, located in the Asia section of the zoo. Visitors can learn about these fascinating creatures and the conservation efforts aimed at protecting them in the wild.</p>
