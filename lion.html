            <h3>LION</h3>
            <p>Lions, known scientifically as Panthera leo, are majestic big cats belonging to the family Felidae. They are iconic symbols of strength, courage, and pride, both in the animal kingdom and human culture. Lions are native to sub-Saharan Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India. These apex predators are renowned for their golden coats, impressive manes, and powerful roars.</p>
            <p>One of the most distinguishing features of lions is the majestic mane that encircles the heads of adult males. The size and color of a lion's mane can vary greatly depending on factors such as age, genetics, and environmental conditions. A full, dark mane is often associated with dominance and is an important trait in mate selection and territorial displays.</p>
            <p>Lions are highly social animals, living in groups known as prides. A typical pride consists of several related adult females, their offspring, and a coalition of dominant males. This social structure provides lions with numerous benefits, including increased hunting success, protection of territory, and care for young cubs.</p>
            <p>As apex predators, lions play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats. They primarily prey on large herbivores such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo, helping to control their populations and prevent overgrazing. Lions are opportunistic hunters and rely on teamwork, stealth, and ambush tactics to bring down prey.</p>
            <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, lions are facing numerous threats in the wild, including habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway to protect lion populations and their habitats, including the establishment of protected areas, community-based conservation initiatives, and anti-poaching patrols.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe lions in the Lion Habitat, located in the African Savannah section of the zoo. Visitors can witness these magnificent big cats in action and learn about the importance of conservation efforts aimed at ensuring their survival in the wild.</p>
