            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
            <p>Giraffes are iconic creatures of the African savannah, belonging to the genus Giraffa within the family Giraffidae. Currently, one species of giraffe is recognized, though it is subdivided into multiple subspecies. These towering mammals are renowned for their long necks, distinctively patterned coats, and graceful movements. Giraffes are native to various countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Namibia.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking features of giraffes is their long necks, which can measure up to 6 feet in length. Contrary to popular belief, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as most mammals, but theirs are elongated. This adaptation allows them to reach high branches and foliage, giving them access to a diverse range of food sources that other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes also have long, dark-colored tongues, which they use to pluck leaves from trees and shrubs.</p>
            <p>In addition to their long necks, giraffes have other distinctive traits. They possess ossicones, which are bony protrusions on the top of their heads covered in skin and hair. These ossicones are present in both male and female giraffes and play a role in thermoregulation and combat between males. Giraffes have large, expressive eyes with excellent peripheral vision, allowing them to detect predators from afar. Their coats feature irregular patches or spots, which serve as camouflage in the dappled light of the savannah.</p>
            <p>Giraffes are herbivores, primarily feeding on leaves, buds, and twigs from acacia trees and other vegetation found in their habitat. They are often seen in loose groups called towers, typically consisting of females and their young, while adult males may roam alone or form bachelor groups. Giraffes are non-territorial and have a peaceful demeanor, although males may engage in necking bouts, a form of combat involving swinging their necks and heads at each other.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You will find the giraffes in the African Plains exhibit, located near the entrance of the zoo.</p>
