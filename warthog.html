            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
            <p>Warthogs are fascinating mammals found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa, belonging to the family Suidae. Known scientifically as Phacochoerus africanus, they are characterized by their distinctive appearance, which includes large tusks and wart-like growths on their faces. Despite their somewhat ungainly appearance, warthogs are highly adapted to their savannah and woodland habitats, where they play an essential role in ecosystem dynamics.</p>
            <p>One of the most striking features of warthogs is their prominent tusks, which are elongated canine teeth that curve upward from the sides of their mouths. These tusks serve multiple purposes, including digging for roots and bulbs, defending against predators, and asserting dominance within social hierarchies. Additionally, warthogs have wart-like growths on their faces, which provide protection during aggressive encounters.</p>
            <p>Warthogs are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of vegetation such as grasses, roots, fruits, and tubers. They are skilled diggers, using their muscular snouts and sharp tusks to root out food from the ground. Warthogs are also known to kneel on their calloused and padded front knees while feeding, a behavior that allows them to reach lower vegetation more easily.</p>
            <p>Despite their formidable appearance, warthogs are preyed upon by a variety of predators, including lions, leopards, hyenas, and crocodiles. To avoid predation, warthogs rely on their keen senses of hearing and smell, as well as their remarkable speed and agility, which allows them to quickly flee from danger. They may also seek refuge in burrows or abandoned dens to escape from predators.</p>
            <p>In addition to their ecological importance, warthogs hold cultural significance in many African societies, where they are featured in folklore, art, and traditional ceremonies. They are also important components of the safari tourism industry, attracting visitors who seek to observe these unique creatures in their natural habitats.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe warthogs in the African Savannah exhibit, located in the heart of the zoo's savannah habitat. Visitors can learn about these fascinating mammals and the critical role they play in the African ecosystem.</p>
