            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
            <p>Monkeys are fascinating primates belonging to the order Primates and the infraorder Simiiformes. They are known for their agile movements, dexterous hands, and complex social behaviors. Monkeys are distributed across various habitats worldwide, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountainous regions. They exhibit a wide range of sizes, behaviors, and adaptations, reflecting their diverse ecological niches.</p>
            <p>One of the most distinctive features of monkeys is their prehensile tails, which many species use for grasping branches and maintaining balance as they navigate their arboreal environments. However, not all monkeys possess prehensile tails; some have tails that serve other functions, such as communication or display. Monkeys have well-developed brains relative to body size, enabling them to exhibit complex behaviors and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>Monkeys are highly social animals, living in groups called troops or bands. These groups vary in size and composition depending on the species and environmental factors. Within troops, monkeys establish dominance hierarchies through social interactions such as grooming, vocalizations, and displays. These hierarchies help maintain order within the group and determine access to resources such as food and mates.</p>
            <p>Monkeys are primarily omnivorous, consuming a varied diet that includes fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals. Their diet often varies depending on seasonal availability and local resources. Monkeys use a combination of manual dexterity and keen eyesight to locate and manipulate food items, with some species even using rudimentary tools to aid in foraging.</p>
            <p>In addition to their ecological importance, monkeys hold cultural significance in many societies around the world. They have appeared in folklore, mythology, and religious iconography, symbolizing traits such as mischief, wisdom, and vitality. However, monkeys also face numerous threats, including habitat destruction, hunting for bushmeat and the pet trade, and conflict with humans over agricultural resources.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe monkeys in the Primate Pavilion, located in the heart of the zoo's conservation area. Visitors can learn about the diverse species of monkeys and the importance of protecting their habitats and populations in the wild.</p>
