            <h3>KOALA</h3>
            <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, belonging to the family Phascolarctidae. Despite their bear-like appearance, they are not bears but rather specialized herbivorous mammals adapted to life in eucalyptus forests. Koalas are well-known for their distinctive appearance, with fluffy ears, a broad nose, and a stout body covered in soft, gray fur. They have a unique ability to grip onto branches with their strong limbs and clawed digits, making them well-suited for life in the treetops.</p>
            <p>One of the most remarkable aspects of koalas is their diet, which consists almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves. These leaves are highly fibrous and toxic to most animals due to their high concentrations of toxins and low nutritional content. However, koalas have specialized digestive systems capable of breaking down these tough leaves and detoxifying the harmful compounds. Despite their limited diet, koalas are able to obtain all the nutrients and water they need from eucalyptus leaves.</p>
            <p>Koalas are predominantly nocturnal creatures, spending the majority of their time sleeping in the branches of eucalyptus trees. They are solitary animals, with each individual occupying a home range that overlaps with those of other koalas. Males are territorial and may engage in vocalizations and scent marking to establish their boundaries and attract mates during the breeding season.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, koalas face numerous threats in the wild, including habitat loss, disease, climate change, and vehicle collisions. Conservation efforts are underway to protect koala populations and their habitats, including the establishment of wildlife corridors, the rehabilitation of injured or sick koalas, and research into diseases affecting koala populations.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe koalas in the Koala Enclosure, located in the Australian Wildlife section of the zoo. Visitors can learn about these fascinating marsupials and the conservation efforts aimed at ensuring their survival in the wild.</p>
