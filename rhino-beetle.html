            <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
            <p>The rhinoceros beetle, also known as the Hercules beetle or horn beetle, is a fascinating insect belonging to the family Scarabaeidae, within the order Coleoptera. These beetles are renowned for their impressive size and distinctive horns, which are used primarily for defense and combat. They inhabit tropical forests and woodlands across the world, with some species found in regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>
           <p>One of the most striking features of the rhinoceros beetle is the large horn-like projection that extends from the head of males. This horn, resembling that of a rhinoceros, is used during mating rituals and battles with other males over territory or mates. Female rhinoceros beetles lack this horn but possess a smaller protrusion or none at all.</p>
           <p>Rhinoceros beetles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on decaying wood, fruits, and sap. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by aiding in the decomposition process and contributing to nutrient cycling. Despite their intimidating appearance, rhinoceros beetles are generally harmless to humans and are valued for their role in agriculture and forestry.</p>
           <p>These beetles undergo a complete metamorphosis, starting as eggs laid in decaying matter. Larvae, commonly referred to as grubs, hatch from the eggs and spend several months to years feeding and growing before pupating. The pupal stage is when the beetle undergoes dramatic physical changes before emerging as an adult.</p>
           <p>In some cultures, rhinoceros beetles are revered and even considered symbols of strength and resilience. They have appeared in folklore, art, and mythology throughout history, showcasing their significance in various societies.</p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>You may find rhinoceros beetles in the Insect Pavilion, located in the zoo's education and conservation center, where visitors can learn about the diverse world of insects and their importance in the ecosystem.</p>
