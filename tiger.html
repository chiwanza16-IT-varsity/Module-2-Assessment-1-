            <h3>TIGER</h3>
            <p>Tigers, scientifically known as Panthera tigris, are majestic big cats native to Asia and are members of the Felidae family. They are renowned for their striking orange coats with black stripes, making them one of the most recognizable animals in the world. Tigers are apex predators and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.</p>
            <p>One of the most distinguishing features of tigers is their powerful build, with muscular bodies and strong jaws equipped with sharp teeth and retractable claws. Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on stealth and ambush tactics to capture prey. They have excellent eyesight and hearing, which aids them in locating and stalking their prey, which includes deer, wild boar, and other large mammals.</p>
            <p>Tigers inhabit a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, and mangrove swamps. They are highly territorial animals, with males having larger territories that overlap with several female territories. Tigers use scent marking and vocalizations to communicate with other tigers and defend their territories from intruders.</p>
            <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, tigers are facing numerous threats in the wild, including habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect tiger populations and their habitats, including the establishment of protected areas, anti-poaching patrols, and community-based conservation initiatives.</p>
            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
            <p>You can observe tigers in the Tiger Enclosure, located in the Asia section of the zoo. Visitors can learn about these magnificent big cats and the importance of conservation efforts aimed at ensuring their survival in the wild.</p>
